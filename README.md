# Coding-Patterns
Typical patterns for coding questions

Motivation
----------
When preparing for coding challenges and technical interviews, I was in search for a way to more 
efficiently practice and to sharpen my skills. Through countless Leetcode problems, I began 
noticing patterns within the questions. 

The [Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions] (https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
contains 16 common patterns for coding questions which taught me how to solve dozens of problems with each of them.

What it does
----------
This repository contains my solutions to the practice problems for each of these patterns.
